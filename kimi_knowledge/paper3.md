# 投射测验(HTP)在心理健康评估中的应用研究

## 摘要

**Objective:** To analyse the current mental health status of college students using the House-Tree-Person Drawing Test (HTP) and the five pattern personality, and to explore the influence of HTP on the five pattern personality, which will provide a reference basis for the management of college students’ mental health.

**Methods:** 239 undergraduates from a university in Guizhou Province were selected to take HTP and Five pattern personality Test by convenient sampling.

**Results:** The five pattern personality of university students are mainly Yy and Peace (42.26%); the Tya, Sya and Tyi scores were lower than the national norm, and Yy and Peace scores were higher than the national norm were statistically significant ( _P_ < 0.05). The HTP results showed that the mouth was missing in Sya personality, and there was a road in front of the door and branches down in Syi personality, and a road in front of the door, small people, and brushing picture in the Tyi personality were all statistically significant ( _P_ < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that there was a road in front of the front, branches down, small people and picture brushing were the influencing factors of the personality of the college students ( _P_ < 0.05).

**Conclusion:** The HTP and the Pentamorphic Personality Inventory can be jointly applied to the assessment of college students’ mental health, and administrators should take targeted interventions to reduce students’ physical and mental burdens according to their specific needs, solve existing psychological problems in a timely manner, and promote the healthy growth of college students.

## 1. 引言

Mental health refers to an individual having vitality, positive inner experiences, good social adaptation, and the ability to effectively utilize personal physical and mental potential and positive social functions. University stage is an important turning point for the physical and mental development and maturation of students, and it is prone to mental health problems. Data shows that the prevalence of depression among college students is about 46.92%, and the prevalence of anxiety is about 33.3%, both higher than the national average. There is also 17.7% of students with self-injury behavior, mainly due to employment pressure, academic pressure, and internet addiction. Therefore, the mental health problems of college students are not optimistic. Currently, various types of psychological assessment scales are used for mental health screening, and the Five Pattern Personality Scale is the first indigenous psychological assessment scale developed in China based on traditional Chinese medicine theory and psychological science foundation. Despite the fixed structure and clear scoring system of this scale, its text content and test questions are subjective, and it cannot ensure that the respondents answer effectively according to the requirements, and it cannot deeply explore potential psychological characteristics.

HTP is one of the projective tests, in which the respondents use drawing to express their psychological state, trigger unconscious emotions and feelings, and project the hidden desires and motives in the subconscious. It can insight into the personality traits and internal psychological state of the drawer, and can make up for the shortcomings of the Five Pattern Personality Scale. HTP has been used for screening mental diseases and psychological treatment in the past, but it is not known whether the two test methods can be used together for the assessment of psychological problems in college students and whether HTP has an impact on the detection of the Five Pattern Personality Test. Therefore, this study used HTP and the Five Pattern Personality Scale to jointly analyze the current mental health status of college students, and explored the impact of HTP on the detection of the Five Pattern Personality, in order to provide a reference basis for the psychological health management of college students by colleges and universities.

## 2. 对象与方法

### 2.1. 对象

A convenient sampling method was used, with undergraduate students from a traditional Chinese medicine university in Guizhou Province as the research objects, aged 18-24 years, with an average age of 20.15 years. Inclusion criteria: 1) Current college students; 2) Informed consent obtained, voluntary participation. Exclusion criteria: 1) Those who took leave during the survey; 2) Incomplete data. All research subjects who met the inclusion criteria were administered the Five Pattern Personality Questionnaire and HTP, with a total of 260 questionnaires distributed, 260 recovered, and 239 valid, with an effective recovery rate of 91.92%.

### 2.2. 方法

#### 2.2.1. 五态人格测验

The Five Pattern Personality Scale established by Xue Chongcheng et al. in 2008 was used, consisting of 103 items divided into six dimensions: Sun, Lesser Yang, Yin-Yang Peace, Lesser Yin, Greater Yin, and the deception dimension. The first five dimensions represent the individual's response intensity, flexibility, balance, perseverance, and approachability to things, and the deception dimension tests the honesty level. All items are scored 1 for “yes” and 0 for “no”. The questionnaire is invalid if the deception dimension is less than 5 points and will be excluded. The Cronbach α coefficient of each dimension is 0.640-0.816, indicating good reliability and validity.

#### 2.2.2. HTP

HTP was proposed by American psychologist Buck, requiring the respondents to draw a house, a tree, and a person on the same piece of white paper. Before the test, the following unified instructions were given: “Prepare a piece of A4 paper, a 2B pencil, and an eraser; draw a picture with a house, a tree, and a person on the paper.” The interpretation of the drawing items refers to previous relevant studies, and the coding is represented by “0” and “1”.

#### 2.3. 统计方法

SPSS 26.0 software was used for statistical processing of the data. Measurement data were expressed as (x̄ ± s), and group comparisons were made using t-tests. Count data were expressed as n(%), and group comparisons were made using chi-square tests. Logistic regression analysis was performed with drawing characteristics as independent variables and Lesser Yin personality scores as dependent variables. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### 3.3. HTP结果

#### 3.3.1. 大学生HTP特征

In this study, the drawings of college students mostly presented common features such as chimneys, open doors, small people, and fruitful trees. Four typical drawings were selected for analysis based on these features, as shown in Figures 1-4.

**Figure 1.** The overall layout of the picture is appropriate, presenting a peaceful and harmonious scene. The house is on the left, with neat lines, layered roof tiles, circular smoke from the chimney, and closed doors and windows. On the right is a fruit tree without roots, with annual ring patterns on the trunk, and grass growing around it. The girl is exercising, with dotted eyes and no nose.

**Figure 2.** The overall lines of the picture are not smooth. The house is three-dimensional, with repeatedly erased contour lines, a chimney on the roof, inward-opening doors, and outward-opening windows, all with shadows. The tree is on the far right, with a shadow on the trunk, single-line branches, and a closed canopy. The figure is small, with only the hair contour and dotted eyes, no eyebrows or mouth.

**Figure 3.** The whole picture is neat and tidy, with the house in the middle, with a high roof, smoking chimney, outward-opening windows, locked doors, and a path in the middle. There are railings on both sides of the house, four trees with full canopies and annual ring patterns on the trunks, and a little girl jumping rope in the lower right corner, wearing a dress and with big eyes.

**Figure 4.** The house is on the left, with lines not smooth, inward-opening doors, and curtained windows. On the right is a large fruit tree with thick trunk and open branches on both sides. The little girl in the middle is in profile, with round eyes, wearing a dress and carrying a school bag.

#### 3.3.2. 不同五态人格的HTP特征差异比较

According to the "Five Pattern Personality Test Manual", each personality was divided into high and low score groups, and the HTP characteristics of the two groups were compared using chi-square tests. There was no statistical significance in the HTP characteristics between the high and low score groups of Sun and Yin-Yang Peace personalities (P > 0.05).

##### 3.3.2.1. 两组少阳人格的HTP特征比较

There was only one drawing feature with statistical significance in the HTP characteristics of Lesser Yang personality (P < 0.05). See Table 3.

## 4. 讨论

### 4.1. 大学生五态人格分析

College students are the future pillars of the country, and their mental health problems are an important part of their growth. The results of this study show that the Five Pattern Personality of college students is mainly Yin-Yang Peace, which is consistent with the results of Lei Yuanying et al., indicating that the students have good balance, possibly due to the influence of traditional Chinese medicine theory and culture in the learning process of the students in this study, forming a personality characterized by calmness, attention to detail, and modesty, which is in line with the personality traits of Yin-Yang Peace. The study shows that there are differences in Sun, Lesser Yin, and Greater Yin scores between different genders, indicating that boys have better flexibility and approachability than girls, and relatively higher psychological endurance. This is consistent with the results of previous studies. The "Inner Canon" points out that there are differences in psychological status between genders, with boys being brave and adventurous, and girls being indecisive. In addition, with the continuous improvement of the rural economic level, the family's emphasis on children has increased, and the gap between the training models of schools and those in urban areas has gradually narrowed, so there is no difference in the scores of the Five Pattern Personality.

### 4.2. HTP结果分析

#### 4.2.1. 少阳人格的HTP特征

The absence of the mouth in the drawing is a manifestation of inner restlessness, unwillingness to communicate with others, and self-repression. Li Miao believes that the lower the sense of happiness, the more likely the mouth is to be omitted in the drawing, and the more likely to avoid interpersonal relationships in life. The frequency of mouth omission in the HTP characteristics of Lesser Yang personality is low, which is consistent with the characteristics of Lesser Yang personality being cheerful, easygoing, unwilling to be quiet, and loving to express inner feelings.

#### 4.2.2. 少阴人格的HTP特征

The relationship between the road and the house reflects the way and choice of an individual's interaction with the outside world and the route of self-emotional outcome . A road in front of the door indicates good interpersonal relationships, while a winding road symbolizes high caution. This may be related to the individual's Yin and Yang content. Traditional Chinese medicine theory usually believes that "孤阴不生，独阳不长", and both Lesser Yin and Greater Yin belong to the Yin category, with similar combinations and changes. Some drawing features may be similar. Downward branches symbolize insufficient ability and strength to achieve individual goals. The data in this study shows that there is a difference in downward branches between the two groups of Greater Yin personality, and downward branches are manifestations of introversion, loneliness, and lack of initiative and decision-making ability, which are consistent with the personality traits of Lesser Yin being highly cautious, calm, and lacking courage.

#### 4.2.3. 太阴人格的HTP特征

Small figures symbolize low sense of security and introversion. The results of this study show that the frequency of small figures in college students' drawings is high. The figure in the drawing is the self-image of the drawer, representing the strong emotional relationship at the conscious level or the "complex" and emotions at the unconscious level. Small figures reflect a personality of low self-esteem and easy withdrawal, which is consistent with the personality traits of Greater Yin being timid and conservative. As shown in Figure 2, the drawer may lack self-cognition and have poor environmental adaptation. Erasure marks reflect obsessive psychology, low self-confidence, or neuroticism. The frequency of erasure marks in Greater Yin personality is high in this study. Erasure marks in the drawing are manifestations of indecision and inner anxiety. Previous studies have found that people with physical and verbal aggressive behavior will have erasure marks in their drawings. Liu Shuyi's survey of hearing-impaired students showed that the higher the anger score, the more obvious the erasure marks in the drawing, which also proves this point.

### 4.3. HTP结果对五态人格的影响

The results of this study show that the OR value of "road in front" is 0.819, which is an influencing factor of Lesser Yin personality, consistent with the characteristics of Lesser Yin personality keeping a certain distance from the outside environment and being cautious in dealing with people and things. Previous studies have found that the frequency of drooping tree crowns in depressed college students' drawings is higher than that in normal college students, indicating that this feature conforms to the characteristics of Lesser Yin personality being indifferent, cautious, and not showing their true feelings. "Picture brushing" as an influencing factor of Greater Yin personality conforms to the personality traits of Greater Yin being suspicious and not taking the lead in doing things. Studies have proved that picture brushing can be used as an indicator for depression assessment, representing the individual's reduced will and behavior, and the concealment of true self. As shown in Figure 4, the entire house lines are not smooth, appearing rigid and lacking flexibility, and the drawer may be prone to nervousness in daily life. "Small people" as an influencing factor of Greater Yin personality indicates suppression and depression. A meta-analysis showed that "small people" (OR = 3.02, P < 0.001) is a significant predictor of mental disorders, proving that "small people" reflect the low mental motivation and energy of Greater Yin personality, leading to avoidance and withdrawal.

## 5. 结论

It is feasible to use the Five Pattern Personality Scale with Chinese cultural characteristics and the representative HTP in drawing projective tests for the mental health assessment of college students. However, there may be some limitations in this study, such as the relatively small sample size of male students, which may prevent the results from being generalized. It is necessary to further expand the sample size for analysis.
